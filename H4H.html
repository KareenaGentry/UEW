          Unlocking Eden's first ministry is called Homes for Haiti. It is a
          for-profit business, locally run and employed. The ministry will be a
          franchise with the company EcoDom (http://en.ecodom.mx/) established in
          Mexico. The homes are built out of recycled material with over 2 tons
          of plastic used per home. This business model provides employment, it
          is environmentally friendly and focused, and makes something beautiful
          out of something initially seen as ugly.

        "Homes for Haiti follows Christ’s calling to heal the afflicted and
        care for the poor by turning trash into housing, offering employment
        which grows self-worth, and transforming whole villages from a few
        hospitable homes, which allows people to become their full selves by
        living into who God has called them to be. By this act of love, the
        people live in a rich relationship with the father and thriving
        communities are created."
